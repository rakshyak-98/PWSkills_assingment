### Q1 What is Database? Explain with an example on why should we need a database.
Database : database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a structural way, so that it can be easily accessed, anaged, and updated.
- we need database to track records, information, events, and maintain them for long period of time with integrity, robust.
- Example: lets consider a retail store which needs to keep track of its coustomers, orders, and products. Whithout a database, the retailer would have to store all of this information in separate files or spreadsheets, making it difficult to manage and analyze the data effectly. With database, the retailer can organize its data in a structured way that makes it easy to query, update and analyze.

### Q2 Write a short not on File base storage system? Explain the major challenges of a File-based storage system.
A File-based system is a type of data storage syste that orgainzes data as files within a hierarchical directory structure. In this system, data is stored in individual files, and the files are stored in directories that can be nested within other directories. One major challenge of File-base storage system is the difficulty in manageing large amounts of data. As the number of files and directories increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the hierarchical structure and locate specific files quickly.
- It has lack of flexibility of accessing and sharing data, as user many need to travel multiple levels of directories.
- Additionally, File-based storage systems are prone to data duplication and inconsistencies.

### Q3 What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?
DBMS stands for "Database Management System" it is a software system designed to anage and organize data in a structured manner.
- A DBMS provides tools of storing, organizing, retrieving and manipulating data in a database.
The needs for DBMS is due to increasing complexity and volumme of the data being generated by organizations.
- DBMS provides many benefits: Data integrity, Concurrent access, Data security, Data backup and recovery, Data sharing.

### Q4 Explain 5 challenges of File-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS?
A File-based storage system si a basic approach to storing data, in which data is organized in files and directories.
1. Data redundancy and inconsistency: data is often duplicated across different files, leading to data redundancy and inconsistency. DBMS uses a centralized approach to data storage, where data is stored in a structured and organized way.
2. Limited data sharing and accessibilit: File-based systems have limited sharing and accessibility options. Access to data is restricted by the file system, and it can be challenging to ensure that multiple users can access and update data simultaneously. DBMS provides a platform for data sharing and accessibility, whith features such as concurrent access and data partitioning.
3. Limited data integrity and security: File-based systems do not provide adequated data integrity and security features. Data can be lost or corrupted due to hardware failure or system crashes. DBMS provides features such as transaction management, data backup, and data recovery to ensure data integrity and security.
4. Lack of scability: File-based systems have limited scalability options. As data volumes increases, file systems become moore complex and difficult to manage. DBMS provides a scalable solution of data storage, where data can be stored across multiple servers and clusters, ensuring that data volumes can be managed effectively.
5. Limited query and analysis capability: File-based system do not provide advanced query and analysis capabilities. Analyzing data requires manual processing and can be time-consuming. DBMS provides advanced query and analysis features, such as SQL and data mining, making it easier to process and analyze large volumes of data.

### Q5 List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.
1. Hierarchical Classification: arranges data in a tree-like structure where each node represents a category or sub-category of data. The parent child relationship between nodes is used to organize and represent data. The parent node can have one or more child nodes, while each child node can only have one parent node. hierarchical classification is best suited ofr data that has a clear hierarchical structure, such as organizational charts or file systems.
2. Network classification: is similar to hierarchical classification but it allows each node to have multiple parent nodes. This type of classification is more flexible thatn hierarchical classification as it can handle data that has complex relationships. Network classification is best suited for data that has multiple relationships, such as project management.
3. Relational classfication: organizes data into tables or relations. Each table represents an entity or concept, while each row in the table represents an instance of the entity. The columns is the table represent the attributes or charactersitics of the entity. Relational classification is most widely used type of classification in DBMS and is best suited for data that has well-defined entities and relationships.
4. Object-oriented classification: represents data as objects, where each object has attributes and methods. The attributes represent the characteristics of the object, while the methods represent the behavior of the object. Object-oriented classification is best suited for data that has complex relationships and behaviors, such as simulations or games.
5. NoSQL classification: is a broad category of databases that do not follow the traditional relational model. These database are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and are best suited for applications that require scalability, flexibility, and high performace. Some example of NoSQL database are MongoDB and Cassandra.

### Q6 What is the significance of Data Modeling and explain the types of data modeling.
Data modeling is the process of creating a conceptual representation of data objects, relationships between them, and rules governing the data's behavior and structure. It helps to organize data into meaningful structures that can be easily understood and used for various purposes.
1. Conceptual data modeling: focuses on the high-level view of data, its relationships, and entities. It is used to define the business concepts and requirements. It does not include any techinical details, and it is usually created with stakeholders or subject matter experts.
2. Logical data modeling: more detailed view of the data that represents the data's structure, entities, and relationships in more detail. It defines the data in a way that is independent of any specific database management system or technology. The output of this type of modeling is often used to generate physical database designs.
3. Physical data modeling: defines the actual physical database structure and represents the database's table, columns, indexes, and constraints. It is a more detailed representaion of data than logical modeling, and it incluedes technical details such as data types, primary and foreign keys and storage requirements.

### Q7 Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.
1. External schema: An external schema defines how a specific user or group of users view the database. It provides a view of the database that is tailored to the specific needs of each user or application.
- Advantage: By defining different external schemas, each user or application can access only the data that is relevant to them. This helps to improve security and data confidentiality.

2. Conceptual schema: represent the entire database and defines the relationship between all the data entities. It is a high-level view of the database that is independent of any particular implementation. The conceptual schema is the blueprint for the entire database system and serves as the foundation for the design of the database.
- Advantage: The conceptual schema provides a comprehensive and organized view of the entire database, making it easier to manage and maintain the data. It also facilitates data integration and ensures data consistency across different applications.

3. Internal schema: defines how the database is physically stored in disk. It includes information such as the file structures, indexing, and data access methods used to retrieve data fro mthe database.
- Advantage: By separating the physical implementation of the database from the conceptual and external schemas, it is possible to make changes to the physical storage without affecting the way data is presented to users or applications. This provides flexibility in managing the database system and optimizing its performance.
